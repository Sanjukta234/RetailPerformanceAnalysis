## Key Findings
- Quarterly Inventory Turnover Ratios (2024):
  - Q1: -0.68
  - Q2: 8.04
  - Q3: 4.28
  - Q4: 7.88
- **Average Inventory Turnover Ratio: 4.88**
- Industry Target: 8.00

## Business Implications
- The companyâ€™s inventory turnover ratio (4.88) is significantly below the industry benchmark (8).
- This indicates **excess inventory and storage costs**, impacting cash flow and profitability.
- Volatility in Q1 and Q3 suggests inefficiencies in supply chain and demand forecasting.

## Recommendations
To reach the industry target of 8, the company should:
1. **Optimize supply chain operations** by improving vendor lead times and reducing overstocking.  
2. **Enhance demand forecasting** through advanced analytics and AI-driven predictive models.  
3. Implement **just-in-time (JIT) inventory practices** to reduce storage costs.  
4. Strengthen coordination between **sales, marketing, and procurement teams** to align demand and supply.

## Visualization
The analysis includes:
- A trend line chart comparing quarterly turnover ratios with the industry benchmark.
